# Smart Slide Generator Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for the Smart Slide Generator projectâ€”a web application that uses AI to generate PowerPoint slides based on user-input slide titles. The roadmap is divided into several phases, from a minimal viable product (MVP) through to extended collaboration and analytics features.

---

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Timeline:** Month 1 - Month 2

- **Requirement Gathering & Concept Validation**

  - Define core functionalities (title input, AI-generated content, PPTX generation)
  - Research and select AI provider (e.g., OpenAI GPT) and PPTX generation library (e.g., PptxGenJS)

- **User Interface Development**

  - Create a simple landing page with a form for slide title input.
  - Display basic output preview of AI-generated content.

- **AI Integration**

  - Develop a backend function to send the slide title to the AI API.
  - Parse the AI response to extract structured data (e.g., bullet points, subtitle, presenter notes).

- **Slide Generation Engine**

  - Integrate PptxGenJS (or a similar library) to generate a PPTX slide from the parsed AI output.
  - Provide a download link for the generated PPTX.

- **Deployment & Testing**
  - Set up a development environment (locally or using Vercel/Heroku).
  - Perform manual testing and gather initial feedback.

## Phase 2: Core Feature Enhancements & UI/UX Improvement

**Timeline:** Month 3 - Month 4

- **Enhanced Slide Editor**

  - Add an interactive preview of the slide as it is generated.
  - Allow basic on-screen editing (e.g., repositioning text boxes, adjusting font sizes).

- **Refine AI Content Generation**

  - Optimize AI prompts for more detailed and consistent slide output.
  - Implement error handling and fallback content in case of API failures.

- **User Feedback Integration**
  - Create a simple in-app feedback mechanism to log issues and suggestions.
  - Iterate on the UI design based on user testing.

---

## Phase 3: User Accounts & Project Persistence

**Timeline:** Month 5 - Month 6

- **Authentication & User Management**

  - Implement user accounts (using JWT, OAuth, or a similar authentication method).
  - Allow users to log in and manage their profile settings.

- **Project Storage & Database Integration**

  - Integrate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM) to store user projects.
  - Save generated slides and allow users to review, edit, or re-download previous projects.

- **API & Backend Enhancements**
  - Secure AI and slide generation endpoints behind the user authentication.
  - Create RESTful or GraphQL APIs for storing and retrieving project data.

---

## Phase 4: Expanded Functionality & Advanced Features

**Timeline:** Month 7 - Month 8

- **Multi-Slide Deck Generation**

  - Allow users to input multiple slide titles to auto-generate a complete presentation.
  - Provide options to reorder, delete, or modify individual slides.

- **Customization Options**

  - Add features for choosing slide themes, layouts, fonts, and colors.
  - Implement drag-and-drop capabilities for layout adjustments.

- **Collaboration Features** (Optional)
  - Enable real-time collaboration on slide decks using WebSockets or WebRTC.
  - Allow multiple users to edit and comment on a presentation concurrently.

---

## Phase 5: Analytics, Feedback & Iterative Improvement

**Timeline:** Month 9 - Month 10

- **Usage Analytics & Logging**

  - Track user interactions and slide generation patterns.
  - Analyze AI-generated content for quality control and prompt optimization.

- **Feedback Loop Implementation**

  - Enable users to rate the AI output and suggest improvements.
  - Use collected data to refine AI prompts and slide layouts over time.

- **Performance & Security Enhancements**
  - Conduct security audits and performance optimization.
  - Ensure scalability, especially for real-time collaboration if implemented.

---

## Phase 6: Final Polishing & Production Launch

**Timeline:** Month 11 - Month 12

- **Comprehensive Testing**

  - Perform unit, integration, and UI testing.
  - Beta test with a small group of users and incorporate their feedback.

- **Documentation & User Guides**

  - Prepare in-depth documentation and tutorial videos.
  - Create FAQ and troubleshooting sections for user support.

- **Marketing & Launch Strategy**

  - Develop a marketing plan including social media, demos, and beta invites.
  - Launch the production version with initial support channels.

- **Post-Launch Monitoring & Maintenance**
  - Monitor user analytics and error logs to ensure smooth operation.
  - Roll out iterative updates based on user feedback and new ideas.

## Future Considerations

- **Integration with Other Productivity Tools**
  - Explore integrations with calendar or note-taking apps to automatically schedule presentations.
- **AI Model Upgrades**
  - Periodically update the AI model or switch providers to improve quality of generated content.
- **Mobile App Development**
  - Consider building a mobile app for slide preview and minor edits on-the-go.
